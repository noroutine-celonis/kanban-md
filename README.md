An agent-first, file-based Kanban board for coordinating AI coding agents and
human supervisors. It runs locally as a single binary: no database, server,
account, or SaaS dependency.

![Demo](assets/demo.gif)

## How to use it

`kanban-md` is flexible, but a typical agent-driven setup looks like this:

1. Install the tool.

```bash
brew install antopolskiy/tap/kanban-md
```

2. Go to your project directory and create a board.

```bash
kanban-md init
```

This creates `kanban/config.yml` and `kanban/tasks/`. The interactive setup
offers to add `kanban/` to `.gitignore`; keep it tracked instead if the board
should travel with the repository.

3. Install the bundled skills for your agents.

```bash
# Install skills locally in this project
kanban-md skill install

# Or install them globally
kanban-md skill install --global
```

4. Create tasks manually, or ask an agent to capture them.

```bash
kanban-md add "Set up CI pipeline" --priority high
kanban-md add "Fix login bug" --priority critical

claude "add ticket: there is a bug on the login page when the user enters an invalid email address"
```

5. Start the `kanban-based-development` skill with one agent. It will claim a
   task, create an isolated worktree, implement and verify the change, merge it,
   release the claim, and mark the task done. Once the workflow fits your
   project, run more agents and supervise their progress in the TUI.

```bash
kanban-md tui
```

6. Adapt the local skill or `AGENTS.md` to the repository's own build, review,
   and release rules.

## Why kanban-md?

Project management tools are designed for humans clicking buttons. kanban-md is designed for AI agents running commands and human supervision.

- **Agent-first.** Token-efficient output (`--compact`), a single-step
  pick/claim/move workflow, structured JSON, and installable skills make the
  board practical inside non-interactive agent loops.
- **Cooperative multi-agent coordination.** Claims reduce duplicate work, can be
  required by selected columns, and expire automatically when an agent stops
  renewing them. Claims are coordination leases, not a security or distributed-
  transaction boundary.
- **Self-healing task IDs.** Commands automatically detect duplicate IDs, filename/frontmatter ID mismatches, and `next_id` drift, then repair them before proceeding.
- **Plain files.** Every task is a Markdown file. Agents, humans, scripts, Git,
  and `grep` can inspect the same source of truth without API credentials.
- **No service dependency.** A single binary owns the local workflow; there is
  no database server, background daemon, or remote configuration service.
- **Skills included.** Pre-written skills for using the CLI tool and a multi-agent development workflow. Installable via `kanban-md skill install`.
- **TUI for observation.** A full interactive terminal board with keyboard navigation. It auto-refreshes when task files change on disk.

```bash
kanban-md tui
```

## Installation

### Homebrew (macOS/Linux)

```bash
brew install antopolskiy/tap/kanban-md
```

### Go

```bash
go install github.com/antopolskiy/kanban-md/cmd/kanban-md@latest
```

Homebrew also installs `kbmd` as a shorthand alias for `kanban-md`.

### Binary downloads

Pre-built binaries for macOS, Linux, and Windows are available on the [Releases](https://github.com/antopolskiy/kanban-md/releases/latest) page.

## Quick start

Agents can run these commands for you, but the same interface is useful for
manual work and scripting.

```bash
# Initialize a board in the current directory
kanban-md init --name "My Project"

# Create some tasks
kanban-md create "Set up CI pipeline" --priority high --tags devops
kanban-md create "Write API docs" --assignee alice --due 2026-03-01
kanban-md create "Fix login bug" --status todo --priority critical

# List all tasks
kanban-md list

# Filter and sort, highest priority first
kanban-md list --status todo,in-progress --sort priority

# Move a task forward
kanban-md move 3 in-progress
kanban-md move 3 --next

# Edit a task
kanban-md edit 2 --add-tag documentation --body "Cover all REST endpoints"

# View task details
kanban-md show 1

# Done with a task
kanban-md move 1 done

# Or soft-delete it by moving it to archived
kanban-md delete 3 --yes
```

## How it works

Running `kanban-md init` creates a `kanban/` directory:

```
kanban/
  config.yml
  tasks/
    001-set-up-ci-pipeline.md
    002-write-api-docs.md
    003-fix-login-bug.md
```

Each task file is standard Markdown with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
id: 1
title: Set up CI pipeline
status: backlog
priority: high
created: 2026-02-07T10:30:00Z
updated: 2026-02-07T10:30:00Z
tags:
  - devops
---

Optional body with more detail, context, or notes.
```

When kanban-md updates a task, it retains unrecognized YAML frontmatter
properties, including exact numeric text, tags, lists, and maps with non-string
keys. Anchors, aliases, and nested YAML merges are retained when their bindings
stay entirely within these properties. This lets other tools keep their metadata
through task edits. By default, additional properties do not appear in table,
compact, or JSON output. You can explicitly select scalar values for the
[property views below](#selected-task-properties). kanban-md's own fields remain authoritative,
including fields you clear.

An update refuses before changing the task file if an extra property aliases a
canonical field or another anchor that cannot be retained safely. Top-level YAML
merges, top-level alias keys, and custom tags on the whole frontmatter mapping
also require manual editing before an update. A quoted `"<<"` property is allowed.
Otherwise valid tasks with this metadata remain readable. If startup needs to
repair an inconsistent task ID or filename and cannot safely rewrite its
metadata, the command fails with an error until you correct the task manually.

kanban-md reserializes its own fields after an update. It does not guarantee
comments, indentation, quote style, original key placement, or byte-for-byte
formatting.

The `config.yml` tracks board settings. A newly initialized board currently
uses schema version 12:

```yaml
version: 12
board:
  name: My Project
tasks_dir: tasks
statuses:
  - name: backlog
    show_duration: false
  - name: todo
  - name: in-progress
    require_claim: true
  - name: review
    require_claim: true
  - name: done
    show_duration: false
  - name: archived
    show_duration: false
priorities:
  - lowest
  - low
  - medium
  - high
  - highest
  - critical
defaults:
  status: backlog
  priority: medium
  class: standard
claim_timeout: 1h
classes:
  - name: expedite
    wip_limit: 1
    bypass_column_wip: true
  - name: fixed-date
  - name: standard
  - name: intangible
tui:
  title_lines: 2
  age_thresholds:
    - after: 0s
      color: "242"
    - after: 1h
      color: "34"
    - after: 24h
      color: "226"
    - after: 72h
      color: "208"
    - after: 168h
      color: "196"
next_id: 1
```

`config.yml` and `tasks/*.md` are authoritative. `activity.jsonl` is a
best-effort, bounded audit log, and `.lock` is a transient coordination file
used by operations that must serialize access. Neither is a hidden database.
Direct task-file edits remain supported, but commands are the claim-aware
mutation path while a task is actively claimed.

## Commands

### `init`

Create a new kanban board.

```bash
kanban-md init [--name NAME] [--statuses s1,s2,s3] [--wip-limit status:N]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--name` | Board name (defaults to parent directory name) |
| `--statuses` | Comma-separated status list (default: backlog,todo,in-progress,review,done,archived) |
| `--wip-limit` | WIP limit per status (format: `status:N`, repeatable) |

After creating a board interactively, kanban-md offers to add the board
directory (for example, `kanban/`) to `.gitignore`:

- If `.gitignore` exists in the board directory parent, the entry is appended.
- If `.gitignore` does not exist, it is created with the board directory entry.

### `create`

Create a new task. Aliases: `add`. Title can be provided as a positional argument or via `--title`.

```bash
kanban-md create "My task" [FLAGS]
kanban-md create --title "My task" --description "Details here" [FLAGS]
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--title` | | Task title (alternative to positional argument) |
| `--status` | config default | Initial status |
| `--priority` | config default | Priority level |
| `--assignee` | | Person assigned |
| `--tags` | | Comma-separated tags |
| `--due` | | Due date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `--estimate` | | Time estimate (e.g. 4h, 2d) |
| `--class` | config default | Configured class of service |
| `--parent` | | Parent task ID |
| `--depends-on` | | Dependency task IDs (comma-separated) |
| `--body` | | Task description (alias: `--description`) |
| `--set-property KEY=LITERAL` | | Set a scalar property; repeat for multiple keys |

### `list`

List tasks with filtering and sorting. Aliases: `ls`.

```bash
kanban-md list [FLAGS]
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--status` | | Filter by status (comma-separated) |
| `--priority` | | Filter by priority (comma-separated) |
| `--assignee` | | Filter by assignee |
| `--tag` | | Filter by tag |
| `-s`, `--search` | | Search tasks by title, body, or tags (case-insensitive) |
| `--blocked` | false | Show only blocked tasks |
| `--not-blocked` | false | Show only non-blocked tasks |
| `--parent` | | Filter by parent task ID |
| `--unblocked` | false | Show only tasks with all dependencies satisfied (missing dependency IDs are treated as satisfied) |
| `--unclaimed` | false | Show only unclaimed or expired-claim tasks |
| `--claimed-by` | | Filter by claimant name |
| `--class` | | Filter by class of service |
| `--archived` | false | Show only archived tasks |
| `--property KEY=LITERAL` | | Match one exact typed scalar value; repeat to combine with AND |
| `--show-property KEY` | | Include a selected scalar in table, compact or JSON output; repeat for multiple keys |
| `--group-by` | | Group counts by assignee, tag, class, priority, status, or `property:KEY` |
| `--hide-claimed-column` | false | Hide the CLAIMED column in table output (no effect on `--json` or `--compact`); defaults to true if `KANBAN_HIDE_CLAIMED_COLUMN` is set |
| `--hide-due-column` | false | Hide the DUE column in table output (no effect on `--json` or `--compact`); defaults to true if `KANBAN_HIDE_DUE_COLUMN` is set |
| `--href` | false | Render TITLE as an OSC-8 terminal hyperlink in table output (no effect on `--json` or `--compact`); defaults to true if `KANBAN_HREF` is set |
| `--sort` | id | Sort by: id, title, status, priority, created, updated, due |
| `-r`, `--reverse` | false | Reverse sort order |
| `-n`, `--limit` | 0 | Max results (0 = unlimited) |

### `show`

Show full details of a task. When the task has direct children, the detail view
includes their IDs, statuses, titles, and a terminal/total roll-up. Parent
status remains independently managed; the roll-up is informational only.

```bash
kanban-md show ID
kanban-md show ID --archived  # include archived children in the roll-up
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--archived` | Include archived direct children (hidden by default) |
| `--show-property KEY` | Include a selected scalar on the task and its children; repeat for multiple keys |

Children are ordered by task ID by default, matching `list --parent`.
Set `children.detail_sort: property:reading_order` to use a numeric property
instead. Finite numbers sort ascending, ties use task ID, and missing or
unsuitable values follow in ID order. This changes detail views only, not list,
board or pick order. See [selected task properties](#selected-task-properties).
Human-readable CLI and TUI detail views prefix them with `├─` and `└─` tree
guides so the parent-child relationship remains visually clear.
Tasks with a direct parent show an upward relation such as
`↑ Parent  #1 [in-progress] Parent title`; if the parent file is unavailable,
the relationship falls back to its stored task ID.
JSON output always contains a `children` array; compact output adds a
`children:DONE/TOTAL done` annotation only when children are present.

**Parent links stay acyclic.** `create` and `edit` reject a parent that would
close a ring, naming the chain it would form:

```
$ kanban-md edit 2 --parent 1
Error: parent would create a cycle (#2 → #1 → #2)
```

`depends_on` is checked the same way, since two tasks that depend on each other
can never become unblocked. Both checks run wherever the link is written, so
`create --parent`, `edit --parent` and `edit --add-dep` are all covered.

A representative board for trying the CLI and TUI behavior is available in
[`examples/issue-11-demo`](examples/issue-11-demo/README.md).

### `edit`

Modify an existing task.

```bash
kanban-md edit ID [FLAGS]
kanban-md edit 1,2,3 --priority high  # batch edit
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--title` | New title (renames the file) |
| `--status` | New status |
| `--priority` | New priority |
| `--assignee` | New assignee |
| `--add-tag` | Add tags (comma-separated) |
| `--remove-tag` | Remove tags (comma-separated) |
| `--due` | New due date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `--clear-due` | Remove due date |
| `--estimate` | New time estimate |
| `--body` | New body text (replaces entire body) |
| `--append-body`, `-a` | Append text to task body |
| `--timestamp`, `-t` | Prefix a timestamp line when appending |
| `--started` | Set started date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `--clear-started` | Clear started timestamp |
| `--completed` | Set completed date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `--clear-completed` | Clear completed timestamp |
| `--parent` | Set parent task ID |
| `--clear-parent` | Clear parent |
| `--add-dep` | Add dependency task IDs (comma-separated) |
| `--remove-dep` | Remove dependency task IDs (comma-separated) |
| `--block` | Mark task as blocked with reason |
| `--unblock` | Clear blocked state |
| `--claim` | Claim task for an agent (set claimed_by) |
| `--release` | Release claim on task |
| `--class` | Set class of service |
| `--set-property KEY=LITERAL` | Set or replace a scalar property; repeat for multiple keys |
| `--clear-property KEY` | Remove a property, distinct from setting it to null |

### `move`

Change a task's status.

```bash
kanban-md move ID [STATUS]
kanban-md move ID --next
kanban-md move ID --prev
kanban-md move 1,2,3 todo          # batch move
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--next` | Advance to next status in the configured order |
| `--prev` | Move back to previous status |
| `--claim` | Claim task for an agent |

### `handoff`

Hand off a task for review. Moves to `review` status, appends a note, and optionally blocks/releases.

```bash
kanban-md handoff ID --claim NAME [--note TEXT] [--block REASON] [-t] [--release]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--claim` | Claim name (required) |
| `--note` | Handoff note to append to body |
| `--timestamp`, `-t` | Prefix a timestamp line to the note |
| `--block` | Mark task as blocked with reason |
| `--release` | Release claim after handoff |

### `delete`

Soft-delete a task by moving it to `archived`. Aliases: `rm`.

```bash
kanban-md delete ID [--yes]
kanban-md delete 1,2,3 --yes       # batch delete
```

Prompts for confirmation in interactive terminals. Use `--yes` (`-y`) to skip
the prompt; it is required in non-interactive contexts and for batch deletion.
The task file remains on disk and can still be listed with `--archived`.

### `archive`

Move a task explicitly to the `archived` status without a confirmation prompt.
Archived tasks are hidden from normal commands (`list`, `board`, `metrics`,
`context`, TUI) but remain on disk. Use `--claim` when archiving a task with an
active claim.

```bash
kanban-md archive ID
kanban-md archive ID --claim agent-1  # archive a task claimed by agent-1
kanban-md archive 1,2,3    # batch archive
```

To see archived tasks:

```bash
kanban-md list --archived
kanban-md list --status archived
```

### `board`

Show a board summary with task counts per status, WIP utilization, blocked/overdue counts, and priority distribution. Aliases: `summary`.

```bash
kanban-md board
kanban-md board --watch    # live-update on file changes
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `-w`, `--watch` | false | Live-update the board on file changes (Ctrl+C to stop) |
| `--group-by` | | Group counts by assignee, tag, class, priority, status, or `property:KEY` |

### `pick`

Find and claim the next available task in one operation. Designed for
cooperative multi-agent workflows where ownership needs to be visible.

```bash
kanban-md pick --claim agent-1
kanban-md pick --claim agent-1 --status todo --move in-progress
kanban-md pick --claim agent-1 --tags backend
kanban-md pick --claim agent-1 --parent 42
kanban-md pick --claim agent-1 --no-body
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--claim` | (required) | Agent name to claim the task for |
| `--status` | all non-terminal | One source status to pick from |
| `--move` | | Also move picked task to this status |
| `--tags` | | Only pick tasks matching at least one tag |
| `--parent` | | Only pick tasks that are children of this parent task ID |
| `--no-body` | false | Show only the pick confirmation line (skip full task details) |

By default, `pick` prints the one-line confirmation and then the full task details (same as `show`, including body) so agents do not need a follow-up `show` command.

The pick algorithm selects from unclaimed, unblocked tasks with satisfied dependencies, prioritizing by class of service (expedite > fixed-date > standard > intangible), then by priority within each class. Fixed-date tasks are further sorted by earliest due date.

### `agent-name`

Generate a random two-word name for use with `--claim`. Uses the system dictionary when available, with a built-in word list as fallback.

```bash
kanban-md agent-name
# → quiet-storm

kanban-md pick --claim $(kanban-md agent-name) --status todo --move in-progress
```

### `metrics`

Show flow metrics: throughput, average lead/cycle time, flow efficiency, and aging work items.

```bash
kanban-md metrics [--since YYYY-MM-DD]
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--since` | | Only include tasks completed after this date |

### `log`

Show the activity log of board mutations. Emitted actions include `create`,
`edit`, `move`, `delete`, `block`, `unblock`, `claim`, `release`, `handoff`, and
TUI priority changes.

```bash
kanban-md log [FLAGS]
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--since` | | Show entries after this date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `--limit` | 0 | Maximum number of entries (most recent) |
| `--action` | | Filter by exact action name |
| `--task` | | Filter by task ID |

### `config`

View or modify board configuration.

```bash
kanban-md config                       # show all config values
kanban-md config get KEY               # get a single value
kanban-md config set KEY VALUE         # set a writable value
```

Available keys:

| Key | Writable | Description |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| `board.name` | yes | Board name |
| `board.description` | yes | Board description |
| `defaults.status` | yes | Default status for new tasks |
| `defaults.priority` | yes | Default priority for new tasks |
| `defaults.class` | yes | Default class of service for new tasks |
| `statuses` | no | List of statuses |
| `priorities` | no | List of priorities |
| `tasks_dir` | no | Tasks directory name |
| `wip_limits` | no | WIP limits per status |
| `claim_timeout` | yes | Claim expiration duration (e.g. `1h`, `30m`) |
| `classes` | no | Class of service definitions |
| `tui.title_lines` | yes | Number of title lines shown in TUI cards |
| `tui.hide_empty_columns` | yes | Hide columns with zero tasks in TUI |
| `tui.narrow_threshold` | yes | Terminal width below which the single-column view is used; 0 is automatic |
| `tui.age_thresholds` | no | TUI age color thresholds |
| `next_id` | no | Next task ID |
| `version` | no | Config schema version |

### `context`

Generate a markdown summary of the board state for embedding in context files (e.g. `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`).

```bash
kanban-md context                             # print to stdout
kanban-md context --write-to AGENTS.md        # write/update in file
kanban-md context --sections blocked,overdue  # limit sections
kanban-md context --days 14                   # recently completed lookback
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--write-to` | | Write context to file (creates or updates in-place) |
| `--sections` | all | Comma-separated section filter |
| `--days` | 7 | Recently completed lookback in days |

Available section names: `in-progress`, `blocked`, `overdue`, `recently-completed`.

When using `--write-to`, the context block is wrapped in HTML comment markers (`<!-- BEGIN kanban-md context -->` / `<!-- END kanban-md context -->`). If the file already contains these markers, only the block between them is replaced — all other content is preserved.

## Interactive TUI

`kanban-md tui` opens a full interactive terminal board with keyboard navigation. It auto-refreshes when task files change on disk.
If no board exists in the current directory, `kanban-md tui` can initialize one and then offers to add that board directory to `.gitignore`.

```bash
kanban-md tui             # launch from any directory with a kanban/ board
kanban-md tui --dir PATH  # point to a specific kanban directory
kanban-md tui --hide-empty-columns  # override config and hide empty columns
kanban-md tui --show-empty-columns  # override config and show empty columns
kanban-md tui --mouse      # opt in to mouse navigation
kanban-md tui --narrow     # force the single-column layout at any width
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--hide-empty-columns` | Hide empty columns for this run, overriding config |
| `--show-empty-columns` | Show empty columns for this run, overriding config |
| `--mouse` | Enable mouse navigation and drag-and-drop |
| `--narrow` | Force the single-column layout at any terminal width |

Set `tui.hide_empty_columns` in `config.yml` to control the default behavior.

> **Note:** Older releases shipped a standalone `kanban-md-tui` binary. It has been retired — use `kanban-md tui` instead.

In create/edit dialogs, text fields support cursor-based editing (`←/→`, `Home/End`, `Backspace`, `Delete`).

Opening a task shows its known ancestor path and the same direct-child list and
roll-up as `show`. Archived ancestors remain visible as context but cannot be
opened; archived children remain hidden. Search and level filters control cards,
not which active relations you can open in details.

### Explore task relations

In details, `Tab` and `Shift+Tab` move the relation focus in reading order;
`Enter` opens it. `Esc` or `Backspace` takes one step back, restoring your
previous task, scroll position and relation focus. `q` closes the entire chain
and returns to the board, keeping its search, level and sort settings. `j`/`k`,
arrow keys and `g`/`G` still scroll the detail content.

Ancestors appear root-first. On a milestone → epic → story path, the first
`Tab` focuses the milestone; `Tab`, `Tab`, `Enter` opens the immediate epic.
From that epic, `Tab`, `Enter` opens the milestone. Two `Esc` presses retrace
those steps. Missing parent IDs and self/cycle markers remain visible rather
than being repaired by navigation.

### Focus one hierarchy level

In board mode, `v` cycles all tasks → the numeric levels present among active
tasks → unknown depth, if present → all. Root tasks are `L0`, their children
`L1`, and so on. Boards with hierarchy show these text labels beside task IDs
and the active `level[...]` in the status line. Flat boards keep their usual
cards by default. While typing a search, `v` is ordinary text.

Levels come from parent links, including archived ancestors, and are not task
types or stored fields. Missing/self-parent links use an effective level-zero
root; a multi-task cycle and tasks reaching it have `L?`. The level filter and
title/tag/ID search combine with AND. Neither writes task data.

Task bodies are rendered as Markdown using the terminal's default foreground
for the main text, so they remain readable when a terminal switches between
light and dark themes while the TUI is running.

### Narrow mode (small terminals)

On terminals too narrow to show every column side by side — a phone over SSH, a
split pane — the board automatically switches to a single-column layout. It shows
one column at a time, full width, under a two-line header: a tab strip of all
columns (the active one highlighted) on top, and the active column's own full
name, count, and WIP limit below. Card titles stay readable instead of being
crushed to a few characters per column.

Switch columns with `←`/`→`, `h`/`l`, or `Tab`/`Shift+Tab`. With `--mouse`, tap a
tab to jump straight to that column; tapping a card selects it as usual.

Narrow mode activates automatically once columns can no longer get a usable
width. To force or tune it:

```bash
kanban-md tui --narrow                         # force narrow mode for this run
kanban-md config set tui.narrow_threshold 80  # persist a custom trigger width
```

Set `tui.narrow_threshold` with `kanban-md config set` (or directly in
`config.yml`) to override the automatic trigger — the board goes narrow below
that terminal width. Use `0` for automatic behavior or `1` to effectively
disable narrow mode.

### Mouse mode

Mouse controls are opt-in, so the normal keyboard-only TUI remains unchanged.
Start mouse mode with:

```bash
kanban-md tui --mouse
```

| Mouse action | Result |
|--------------|--------|
| Click a card | Select the card and synchronize keyboard navigation |
| Double-click the same card within 500 ms | Open its detail view |
| Click an active relation row in details | Open that task, including wrapped rows |
| Click `Back` | Take one detail-history step, or return to the board when history is empty |
| Wheel over a column | Activate that column and move its selection one card |
| Wheel in a detail view | Scroll the task body three lines |
| Hold a card, drag to another visible column, and release | Move the task to that status |

The entire rendered destination column is a drop target, including its header,
cards, and visible empty area. Releasing over the source column or outside a
valid column cancels the drag. Keyboard shortcuts continue to work while mouse
mode is active, so both input styles can be mixed freely.

The board status line begins with the card count and `? help`, followed by the
optional mouse indicator and the remaining actions. Shortcut characters are
highlighted inside their action labels so the essential hints survive narrow
terminal widths.

Status moves made in the TUI preserve an existing task claim. If an unclaimed
task enters a `require_claim` status, the TUI automatically claims it using the
local hostname; that claim remains attached if the task later moves elsewhere.

Terminals commonly reserve a modifier such as Shift or Option/Alt to bypass
application mouse reporting for native text selection. The exact modifier is
terminal-dependent; use the terminal's normal selection shortcut or omit
`--mouse` when native selection is preferred.

### Keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `h` / `l` | Move between columns |
| `j` / `k` | Move between tasks within a column |
| `Enter` | View task details |
| `c` | Create task in current column |
| `e` | Edit selected task (same 4-step flow as create) |
| `E` | Open the selected task's Markdown file in `$VISUAL`, then `$EDITOR`, then `vi` when available |
| `m` | Move task to a different status (picker dialog) |
| `n` / `p` | Move task to next / previous status |
| `d` | Soft-delete (archive) task with confirmation |
| `s` | Cycle the sort field (priority → created → updated → title) |
| `S` | Reverse the sort direction |
| `/` | Search/filter tasks live. Matches a case-insensitive substring of the title or any individual tag, not the body. Start with `#` for ticket IDs: `#12` prefix-matches IDs, `#12 ` exact-matches #12, and bare `#` matches all. `Enter` keeps the filter, `Esc` clears it |
| `v` | In board mode, cycle exact hierarchy levels; session-only |
| `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` in details | Focus relations in reading order |
| `Enter` in details | Open the focused relation |
| `Esc` / `Backspace` in details | Go back one navigation step |
| `r` | Refresh board |
| `?` | Show help |
| `q` | Quit from the board; close the whole detail chain from details |
| `Ctrl+C` | Quit |

## Global flags

These work with any command:

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--json` | Force JSON output |
| `--table` | Force table output (default) |
| `--compact` / `--oneline` | Compact one-line-per-record output |
| `--dir` | Path to kanban directory (overrides auto-detection) |
| `--no-color` | Disable color output (also respects `NO_COLOR` env var) |

### Output format

The default output format is **table** (human-readable). Use flags to switch:

```bash
# Default: table
kanban-md list --status todo

# Compact: one line per task, ideal for AI agents
kanban-md list --compact

# JSON: for scripting and piping
kanban-md list --json | jq '.[].title'
```

Set the `KANBAN_OUTPUT` environment variable to change the default: `json`, `table`, `compact`, or `oneline`.

Override priority: `--json`/`--table`/`--compact` flags > `KANBAN_OUTPUT` env var > table default.

## Configuration

kanban-md discovers its config by walking upward from the current directory, similar to how `git` finds `.git/`. This means you can run commands from any subdirectory in your project.

Use `--dir` to point to a specific board:

```bash
kanban-md --dir /path/to/kanban list
```

### Custom statuses

Define your own workflow columns:

```bash
kanban-md init --statuses "open,in-progress,blocked,closed"
```

The order matters — it defines the progression for `move --next` and `move --prev`, and the sort order for `list --sort status`.

### Custom priorities

Edit `config.yml` directly to customize priorities:

```yaml
priorities:
  - trivial
  - normal
  - urgent
  - showstopper
defaults:
  priority: normal
```

Priority order runs from lowest to highest. `list --sort priority` shows the
highest configured priority first by default; use `--reverse` for lowest first.

### Hyperlinked titles

`list --href` (or `KANBAN_HREF`) renders TITLE as a clickable OSC-8 terminal
hyperlink in table output, resolving the link target in this order:

1. An explicit `https://` `href` property, set with
   `--set-property 'href="https://example.com"'`.
2. Otherwise, the first `https://` link found in the task body — either a
   markdown `[text](https://...)` target or a bare `https://` URL.
3. Otherwise, the title is rendered plain.

Set `--set-property href=false` to opt a task out of hyperlinking entirely,
including the body fallback.

`http://` targets, in either the `href` property or the body, are never
linked. This follows `--no-color`/`NO_COLOR`: disabling color also disables
hyperlinks, and has no effect on `--json` or `--compact` output. Only the
title text itself is clickable; column padding is never part of the link.

### Selected task properties

Use your own top-level scalar properties for categories, reading order or other
workflow data, without adding a task type or rank to the core model:

```bash
kanban-md create "Draft chapter" --parent 1 \
  --set-property kind=chapter --set-property reading_order=20
kanban-md edit 2 --set-property reading_order=10
kanban-md list --property kind=chapter --show-property reading_order
kanban-md list --group-by property:kind
kanban-md show 1 --json --show-property kind --show-property reading_order
```

Repeat `--set-property`, `--clear-property`, `--property` and `--show-property`
for different keys. Keys are case-sensitive literal names matching
`[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_.-]*`; a dot is part of the key, not a nested path.
Task-owned names such as `status`, `priority`, `parent`, `body` and `file` are
reserved: use their existing flags. Duplicate keys and simultaneous set/clear
of the same key are errors. Multi-task edits retain the normal per-task batch
behavior, not an all-or-nothing transaction.

CLI literals support a bare string, a JSON-quoted string, a decimal/scientific
number, lowercase `true`/`false`, or `null`. Shell quotes protect the argument;
inner JSON quotes choose a string instead of a number or boolean:

```bash
kanban-md edit 2 --set-property reading_order=20      # number
kanban-md edit 2 --set-property 'reading_order="20"'  # string, not a numeric order
kanban-md edit 2 --set-property 'note=""'             # empty string
kanban-md edit 2 --set-property note=null            # present null
kanban-md edit 2 --clear-property note               # absent key
```

The authoring grammar does not evaluate YAML tags, aliases, arrays or maps.
Use strict JSON numeric spelling on the CLI: quote `01`, `+20`, `.5`, `0x10`
or `1_000` if you mean text. Reading existing YAML numeric forms is exact,
including large values and base-prefixed integers; numeric-looking strings
remain strings. Property equality is typed and exact. Repeated filters and
ordinary filters combine with AND. Missing and unsupported values never match,
including a filter for null.

Edit these optional view settings directly in `config.yml`:

```yaml
group_orders:
  property:kind: [milestone, chapter, story, bug]
display:
  compact_fields: [status, property:kind]
tui:
  card_fields: [property:kind]
children:
  detail_sort: property:reading_order
```

Omit them to retain `[status/priority]` compact chips, the TUI priority badge
and ID-ordered children. Compact/card fields accept one or two distinct choices
from `status`, `priority`, `class` or `property:KEY`; empty and null lists are
invalid. Omit the field to use its defaults. Restart an open TUI after changing
these config settings; its refresh command reloads tasks, not view settings.
Compact fields apply to `list`, `show` and `pick`; other command confirmations
keep their existing format.
Child detail sort accepts `id` or one numeric property selector. Config version
12 migration preserves the old effective defaults and does not rewrite tasks.

Group order is a presentation preference, not an enum. Configured values appear
first; other strings follow alphabetically, then numbers, booleans and null.
Missing or unsupported values share the last `(unclassified)` group. Scalar
group labels are quoted/typed to keep text `"20"` distinct from number `20`.
For example, a typo such as `chapetr` remains visible in the grouped summary;
correct it with `edit ID --set-property kind=chapter`. Grouped output contains
counts, not task records, so it cannot be combined with `--show-property`.

Only `list` and `show` accept `--show-property`. It adds selected columns/tokens
to human output and a `properties` object to each JSON task or child record.
Missing keys are omitted, explicit null is present as null, and unsupported
values are omitted with a warning. Nested, alias, timestamp, binary,
custom-tagged and non-finite values remain preserved but are not selected
scalars. Unselected metadata never enters task JSON. Display and sort settings
do not select JSON values; use `--show-property` explicitly.

Human badges use `KEY=--` for missing, `KEY=?` for unsupported and `KEY=null`
for null; strings are quoted. Control characters are escaped and long badge
values are shortened. Details show the selected properties that explain the
view; JSON keeps their complete supported values when explicitly requested.

Child ordering never changes priority, pick, dependencies, claims or WIP.
Zero, negative and fractional numbers are valid; sparse values such as 10, 20,
30 leave room for inserts. Reparenting or clearing a parent retains the property.
To reset placement when detaching, clear both in one edit:

```bash
kanban-md edit 2 --clear-parent --clear-property reading_order
```

An explicit property replacement/removal can still refuse if it would leave
another retained YAML alias unsafe. The error leaves the task file unchanged
and asks for manual frontmatter editing; unrelated values are not rewritten
to make the edit succeed.

## Agent skills

kanban-md ships with installable skills that teach AI agents how to use the board. Skills are auto-triggered prompt files that give agents command references, decision trees, and workflows — so they manage tasks correctly without you writing custom instructions.

Two skills are included:

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **kanban-md** | Command reference, decision trees, and workflows for managing tasks via CLI. Auto-triggered when an agent encounters task-related work. |
| **kanban-based-development** | Full autonomous development workflow — multi-agent claim semantics, git worktrees for isolation, and a strict status lifecycle (in-progress → review → done). |

```bash
# Install skills for all detected agents (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenClaw)
kanban-md skill install

# Check if installed skills are up to date
kanban-md skill check

# Update skills to match current CLI version
kanban-md skill update

# Preview one skill
kanban-md skill show --skill kanban-md
```

Skills are versioned to match the CLI. When you upgrade kanban-md, `skill check` tells you if your installed skills are outdated, and `skill update` brings them in sync.

## Multi-agent workflow

kanban-md coordinates concurrent work by multiple agents and humans through
cooperative claims and classes of service.

### Claims

Claims are cooperative leases: an agent claims a task before working on it, and
well-behaved agents exclude tasks with active claims from selection. Claims
expire after the configured timeout (default: 1 hour). They reduce collisions,
but they are not a security boundary or a transactional distributed lock.

On Unix-like systems, kanban-md also makes actively claimed task files read-only. Commands from the current claimant temporarily unlock the file while updating it, then restore read-only permissions; releasing or expiring the claim makes the file writable again. This protects against accidental direct edits by another process running as the same user, but it is not a security boundary: that user can still change permissions, rename, or delete the file.

Statuses with `require_claim: true` (default: `in-progress` and `review`) enforce that every `move` or `edit` includes `--claim <name>`. This prevents accidental anonymous moves in multi-agent environments.

```bash
# Agent picks next available task
kanban-md pick --claim agent-1 --move in-progress

# Move to review (require_claim enforced — must include --claim)
kanban-md move 5 review --claim agent-1

# Agent finishes and releases
kanban-md edit 5 --release
kanban-md move 5 done

# Another agent picks from a specific queue
kanban-md pick --claim agent-2 --status todo --tags backend
```

### Classes of service

Tasks can have a class of service that affects WIP limits and pick priority:

| Class | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **expedite** | Bypasses column WIP limits. Has its own board-wide WIP limit (default: 1). Picked first. |
| **fixed-date** | Picked by earliest due date within its priority tier. |
| **standard** | Default class. Normal WIP and priority rules. |
| **intangible** | Picked last. For background/maintenance work. |

```bash
kanban-md create "Critical hotfix" --class expedite --priority critical
kanban-md create "Q2 deadline feature" --class fixed-date --due 2026-06-30
```

### Swimlanes

Group board or list views by any field to see work distribution:

```bash
kanban-md board --group-by assignee     # who is working on what
kanban-md board --group-by class        # class of service breakdown
kanban-md list --group-by tag           # work by tag
kanban-md list --group-by priority      # priority distribution
```

## Design principles

kanban-md provides orthogonal, composable workflow primitives. Development is
one use, not the definition of its domain. These principles guide new features
and reviews; they are not a claim that every existing implementation meets them.

1. Compose workflows; make new domain concepts earn their place. Prefer shared
   capabilities over built-in concepts named after one workflow.
2. Choose the smallest capability that actually solves the need. Count user
   effort and maintenance cost; a generic framework is not automatically simpler.
3. Keep the basic board complete; make workflow policy optional. Extras should
   impose no required setup or default clutter. Usability and data protection
   still deserve sensible defaults.
4. Give each value and action one explicit meaning. Separate task data, relations,
   views, and policy. Display order must not silently become execution order.
5. Keep local files authoritative and the core independently useful. Optional
   integrations must not make ordinary board use depend on accounts or services.
6. Preserve contracts across interfaces, upgrades, and writers. Keep mutations
   consistent, agent commands non-interactive, and existing boards compatible.

The project-local [principal-owner skill](.agents/skills/kanban-md-principal-owner/SKILL.md)
contains the review criteria, tradeoffs, and decision format. It is contributor
guidance, not one of the workflow skills installed into users' projects.
